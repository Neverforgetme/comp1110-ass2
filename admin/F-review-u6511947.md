Review Comments:

1. TwistGame.java:78-89 Uses hashset and arraylist as an alternate method
   to store placement data.
2. TwistGame.java:64-136 The code is minimally documented and consistent
   variable naming. The documentation can be improve be more specific on
   how the code works.
3. TwistGame.java:64-136 The program is decomposed appropriately as all
   the functions are on the same class.
